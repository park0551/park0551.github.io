                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Taylor Park. I'm mixed Korean-Canadian residing in and attending school in Canada.
                    Incidentally, my legal first name is Jaehee - which is Korean. Taylor is my middle name, which I've
                    unofficially adopted as my first/preferred name since 2<sup>nd</sup> grade. I love my first name,
                    but at
                    this point everyone already knows me as Taylor. My mom and I moved to Ottawa in the early 2000s and
                    I've
                    lived in and around the Ottawa area ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main interest in life has always been visual art. I love illustration and recently have become
                    very
                    interested in storytelling through the means of webcomics. In the past two years I've taught myself
                    how
                    to
                    use <abbr title="Clip Studio Paint">CSP</abbr> (a popular artist program for iPad, PC, Mac, etc.)
                    and
                    have
                    made a goal to eventually post my own webcomic online for others to see.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favourite quote comes from the memoir, <em>Tuesdays with Morrie.</em> Even though this was one of
                    those
                    books we had to read in high school, it easily became one of my favourites. Morrie had many
                    aphorisms
                    about
                    life that helped get me through a time when I was diagnosed with a chronic illness. Even after the
                    darkest
                    part of this ordeal, I appreciate and think about his aphorisms all the time.
                </p>
